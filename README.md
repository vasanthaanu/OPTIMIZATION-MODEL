#DESCRIPTION

üìå Overview: This project is part of CodTech‚Äôs Internship Task-4, where the main goal is to solve a business problem using optimization techniques. Optimization is a key part of many real-world business scenarios where the goal is to maximize profit, minimize cost, or use resources efficiently.

In this task, we used a method called Linear Programming (LP), one of the most popular techniques in operations research. The project was fully built using Python, specifically using a powerful optimization library called PuLP. All development and execution were done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a modern code editor preferred by many developers.

üõ† Tools & Technologies Used: Python (3.x) The main programming language used for building the model. Python is great for optimization because of its readability and wide range of scientific libraries.

PuLP Library A Python library that helps formulate and solve Linear Programming problems. PuLP allows us to define decision variables, objective functions, and constraints easily.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) The IDE used to write, debug, and run the code. It's lightweight, has great extensions for Python, and gives a clean terminal output for optimization results.

Command Line / Terminal Used inside VS Code to run the Python file and install libraries.

GitHub (Optional) The project can be pushed to GitHub to showcase work publicly and manage versions.

üîç Problem Statement: A factory manufactures Product A and Product B. Both products require labor hours and raw materials. The factory has limited resources and wants to maximize profit.

We need to determine:

How many units of Product A to produce?

How many units of Product B to produce?

What‚Äôs the maximum profit possible under resource constraints?

üìä Model Setup: Decision Variables: Let x be the number of Product A, and y be the number of Product B to produce.

Objective Function (What we‚Äôre maximizing): Maximize: Profit = 40x + 50y

Constraints:

Labor hours: 2x + 3y <= 100

Material used: 3x + 2y <= 120

x, y ‚â• 0 and must be integers (no half products!)

‚úÖ Conclusion: This project successfully fulfills CodTech Internship Task 4. It uses modern tools and programming techniques to solve a classical optimization problem. By using VS Code, Python, and PuLP, the task was completed efficiently and provides clear insights into the production strategy for maximum profit.

The project is clean, repeatable, and can be shared on platforms like GitHub for portfolio use. It‚Äôs a great intro into the world of operations research, optimization, and data-driven decisions.
